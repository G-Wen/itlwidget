To run the widget:
1. Change the entrant id at the start of `widget.js` to your own entrant id. Save.
2. Set `index.html` as a browser source for your stream.

Customizations:
To use the light theme change the stylesheet in `index.html` from `themes/dark/style.css` to `themes/light/style.css`.

If you want to change the profile picture replace Avatar.png with the picture you want. 
 - If you want to use an alternative file format/file name specify the source inside of `widget.js`.

If you want to change the background picture replace bg.png with the picture you want. 
 - If you want to use an alternative file format/file name specify the source inside of `style.css`.

If your name is too long you can override the name it shows by providing an override name at the start of widget.js.
